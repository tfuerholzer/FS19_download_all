# FS19 Download All mods

Just download main.py, get Python 3.xx and install beautifulsoup4 with pip. I recommend pycharm if you aren't familiar with this process.

Simple Script I wrote that downloads all mods from the https://farming-simulator.com/ site for Farming Simulator 19. Why? 
Because it takes forever and the site is not that great.

Don't even think about looking here for good Python code. I haven't used Python in a super long time and just wrote this script in an hour so I don't feel like an idiot for manually going through the games site and press the download button 500 million times. But maybe it helps you too.
